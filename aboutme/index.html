    <h2>Okolie Collins</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
    <p>I'm Collins, and I'm from Nigeria, currently reside in Lagos State Nigeria. I'm single with no children at the moment but hoping to get married soon, I'm pursuing a career in software development annd that is why I'm involved in this class. I love nature, swimming, playing football and table tennis, I listen to music when I'm bored or need to be inspired to do something new, I love to meet new people and also to work with them.</p>
    <p>My favourite quote is "If you want to change the world, you have to look at the man in the mirror and start with him". I hope to learn more from you all and hope that we all work together to meet our goals. Thank you all so much and I love you all.</p>
